# Algae Brew

## End Goal
The end goal of the Algae Brew project is to use microalgae to produce Biodiesel(primary goal) and Animal feed for livestock(secondary goal).

The primary goal of biodiesel production would utilise the lipid content of microalgaes, where as the secondary goal of providing an animal feed would use the 'waste' dry matter left after lipid extraction.

## Stepping stone projects:

### Selecting algae species

This part is nearly purely reading previous work.

An algae spieces obviously needs to be chosen. As I see it there are 2 requirements that need to be met:

 - High lipid content
 - Safe for use as animal feed stock

Without these two conditions met the species of algae doesn't serve well for this project.

There are addtional charactaristics that are preffable:

The first is that it would help for the algae species to have a high neutritional content for livestock. This would change depending on the perticular live stock so may serve well to utilise multiple seperate species (more research needed).

Secondly that the algae can be grown easily in different climates. Like with the first i suspect that this won't be achieved with one species and different species would need to be picked out for different climates (more research needed).

### Refinement

As I see it there are 3 different things that need to happen for refinement:

1. Lipid extraction from algal biomass
2. Lipid conversion to biodiesel
3. waste drymatter to animal feed

The first 2 would both be chemistry based persuites whilst the 3rd I haven't currently done enough reading to know what it would involve.

For the first stage from what I have read it would be between a Soxhlet reaction using ethenol as a solvent and the simultaneous distillation and extraction process described in the paper [[New procedure for extraction of algal lipids from wet biomass A green clean and scalable process.pdf]].

The second stage appears to be achievable with a KOH catalyst as shown in [[Conversion of lipid from food waste to biodiesel.pdf]].

I don't actually have much chemistry knowledge though so this definaitly needs to be looked into more by someone who knows about it or really wants to take a deep dive into it.

I suspect the 'waste' algae can just be pressed into pellets for animal feed, but haven't done any real reading on this yet. It's just using my own knowledge from working at stables.

These methods should also be concidering the scalability.

### Growth conditions

Optimal growing conditions that maximise the production of lipids needs to be determind.

This will take quite a bit of experimentation and will change depending on species so benifits massively from have quite a few people who can investigate it.

### Design growth system

Whilst for experimenting and developing techniques the growth apparatus isn't massively important, to start concidering scaling this up to actually be able to provide biodiesel for a section of a population.

One area of scaling for this is the growth of the algae. The research needs to be done to determine weather photobioreactors or open ponds are more energy efficient way to grow large ammounts of algae.

This research is likely a mixture of calculations and reading previous research. this would be followed up by CAD work to design prototype growers.

### Testing the scalability of refinement

As the title says the final stage would be to test the scalability of the refinement methods. After that then all the pieces would be put together to allow people to start large scale production of algal biofuel.
