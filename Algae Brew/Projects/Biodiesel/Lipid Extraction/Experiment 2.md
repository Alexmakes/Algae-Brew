# Experiment 2 - Comparing with SDEP

Next step of this project is recreating the paper [[New procedure for extraction of algal lipids from wet biomass A green clean and scalable process.pdf]]].

## Equipment:

### Non-disposables:

- Round bottomed-flask
- Condenser tube
- Dean stark receiver (with 3-way selector)
- Soxhlet tube
- Plug power monitor
- Hot water bath (for heating flask)
- Retort Stand
- Boss Head
- Clamps

### Disposables:

 - Cellulose filter for Soxhlet tube.
 - Microalgae (spiralina sp.?)
 - Terpene Solvents
 - N-hexane Solvent


## Methods:

### Soxhlet:

1. Place dry algal biomass in Cellulose filter.
2. Place filter in Soxhlet tube.
3. Place Soxhlet tube on Round-bottomed flask.
4. Place Condencer tube on Soxhlet tube.
5. Plug the Condencer tube.
6. Heat round bottom flask.
7. Leave running for X hours.
8. Seperate Lipids from solvent.
9. Measure extracted lipids.


### SDEP:

1. Place 20% dry weight algal biomass in round-bottom flask.
2. Add 100 mL of solvent to round-bottom flask.
3. Put Dean stark reciever with 3-way valve on round-bottomed flask and top with capped Condencer tube.
4. Distill of the water from the biomass, this is collected in the Dean stark receiver.
5. Wait 30 minutes for solvent to disolve the lipids.
6. Re-introduce water.
7. Use of hydrodistillation to extract solvent.
8. Heat solution to just below water boiling point to perform azeotropic distillation.
9. Seperate the solvent and water vial phase separation in the Dean stark receiver.
10. Phase seperation used again to seperate lipids and water.
11. Mesure extracted lipids.
