# Experiment 1 - Basic Soxhlet reaction

Firstly step of this project is recreating the paper [[Extraction of algae oil from nannocloropsis sp. A study of Soxhlet and Ultrasonic-Assisted Extractions.pdf]].

## Equipment:

### Non-disposables:

- Round bottomed-flask
- Condenser tube
- Soxhlet tube
- Plug power monitor
- Hot water bath (for heating flask)
- Retort Stand
- Boss Head
- Clamps

### Disposables:

 - Cellulose filter for Soxhlet tube.
 - Microalgae (spiralina sp.?)
 - N-hexane Solvent
 - Methanol Solvent
 - Ethanol Solvent


## Methods:

### Soxhlet:

1. Place dry algal biomass in Cellulose filter.
2. Place filter in Soxhlet tube.
3. Place Soxhlet tube on Round-bottomed flask.
4. Place Condencer tube on Soxhlet tube.
5. Plug the Condencer tube.
6. Heat round bottom flask.
7. Leave running for X hours.
8. Seperate Lipids from solvent.
9. Measure extracted lipids.
