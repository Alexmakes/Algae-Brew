Notes on paper [[Extraction of algae oil from nannocloropsis sp. A study of Soxhlet and Ultrasonic-Assisted Extractions.pdf]]

## Introduction

Nannochloropsis sp. has a lipid level of 12-53%. Moreover their lipid productivity level is 27-90 mg/L/day.

The common extraction methods for getting lipids from plants are:
 - Pressure
 - Soxhlet
 - Osmosis Pressure
 - Microwave
 - Supercritical
 - Ultrasonication

This paper tested Ultrasonication and Soxhlet.

## Methods

### Materials:

- Powerded Nannochloropsis sp. (baked at 80c for 8 hours)
- Ethanol solvent (concentration 66-94%)


### Soxhlet process:

The Soxhlet reaction was performed for 80 minutes, 100 minutes, 150 minutes, 200 minutes and 220 minutes.

The ethanol was added at a ratio of 1:3 (grams of algae : mL of ethanol).

Lastely distilation was used to seperate the oil and ethanol.


### Ultrasonication Extraction:

They used an ultrasonic cleaning bath or 150/200W of nominal power, with dimensions of 300x150x150 mm and a frequency of 40 kHz.

The ethanol and algae were added at ratios of 1:3, 1:5, 1:10. 

The times spans used where 10, 20, 30 minutes.

Each of these were tried at the tempretures of 23c, 40c, and 60c.


## Their Results
