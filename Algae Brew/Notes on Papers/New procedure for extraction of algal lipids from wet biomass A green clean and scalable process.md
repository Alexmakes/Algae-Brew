Notes on paper [[New procedure for extraction of algal lipids from wet biomass A green clean and scalable process.pdf]]

## Introduction

- 20-50% of dry weight of microalgae are lipids.
- Can be grown on non-arable nutrient poor land.
- Use of n-hexane extraction accounts for up to 90% of the total process energy.
- Removing the need for drying reduces energy costs of biodiesel production.
- Use of petroleum solvents costs more than other solvent options.

## Methods:

### Other methods:

 - Soxhlet reaction with n-hexane solvent
 - Bligh & Dyer method

### SDEP method:

#### Materials:
- Round bottomed flask
- Dean stark receiver
- condenser tube
- Terpene solvents

#### Setup:
1. 12 +- 0.5g of 20% dray weight microalgae paste were placed in 500mL round-bottomed flask.
2. 100mL of terpene solvent was added in order to immerse the wet microalgae sample.
3. The flask was surmounted by a modified Dean stark receiver with a 3-way valve and fitted with a condenser.

#### Process:
1. Heating was maxed until the collections of the first droplets of microalgae water in the Dean stark receiver. Then the heating was adapted until most of the water had been distilled.
2. They waited for 30 min.
3. The water gets reintroduced.
4. Use hydrodistillation to extract terpenes, and induce the use of an azeotropic distillation.
5. The azeotropic distillation was performed by heating the solution to just below the boiling point of water (they used 97.6c).
6. The terpene solvent was then recovereed from teh water layer by phase separation in the modified dean stak receiver.
7. The extracted lipids were then recovered from the water layer by phase separation in the distillation round-bottomed flask.


## Their Results:

### Lipid extraction

The had best results with N. oculata microalgae. The different techniques had no noticable difference in the compasision of the lipids.

The Soxhlet reaction had the lowest yield of 8.31% +- 1.05% of dry weight extracted as lipids. The Bligh and Dyer method had the highest yield of 23.78% +- 2.13% of dry wieght extracted as lipids.

Using the SDEP method the best solvent was p-Cymene with a 21.45% +- 2.64% of dry weight extracted as lipids.

### Energy consumption

The monitored the energy consumption of all apparatus used (heater, freeze dryer, etc). They found that the Soxhlet reaction yielded 1g of lipids per 8.84 kWh, and the SDEP method yielded 1g per 2.15 kWh used.

Showing the SDEP is far more energy efficient.
