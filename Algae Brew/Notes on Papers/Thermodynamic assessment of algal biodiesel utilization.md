Notes on [[Thermodynamic assessment of algal biodiesel utilization.pdf]]

## Introduction


## Algae and algal oil production process

They grew the algae in a glass covered pond, with light intensity of 2000 uE/m^2s.
They adjusted the depth of the pond till the light intensity within the growing region of algae was 200uE/m^2s

An algal cell concists of Lipids and the rest of the cell. The rest of the cell is 50% carbon, 20% Oxygen, 14% nitrogen, 3%phosphorus, 1% sulfur, 1% potassium, 0.5% calcium, 0.5% magnesium, 0.5% chlorine, 0.2% iron and 0.3% misc stuff.

The algae were fed with the following salts (per 72kg water):
 - 2kg CA(OH)2
 - 6kg KCl
 - 1kg MgSO4
 - 4.7kg NaH2PO4
 - 1kg FeCl2
 - 16kg NH4Cl

## Biodiesel production process

### Plant biodiesel

The conventional biodiesel production process is, put oils/fats through transesterification reaction with an alcohol at 55-65c with a catalyst. 

This process has a 98% conversion in 1h.

This produces a by product of glycerol additionally.

### Algal biodiesel

Process for algal biodiesel production is, the catalyst (sodium ethanolate) is mixed with ethanol. The ammount of catalyst is dependent on the ammount of oil. For 1 tonne of biodiesel, 957kg of algal oil is needed with 8kg of catalyst and excess ethanol is used (in this case 258kg).




## Conclusion

The paper concluded that the Algae -> Biodiesel -> Carbon dioxide cycle provides a useful amount of work.

They found that it takes almost 3/4 of the energy produced to produce the same ammount of biodiesel and restore the enviroment to the state it was before production.

The efficiency of this cycle can be improved via the use of renewable energy sources for production or via increasing the lipid content of the algae.
